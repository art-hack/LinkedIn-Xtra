# LinkedIn Xtra
 
Disclaimer: I have not created this extension but have been a user for quite sometime. The extension was removed from the Chrome Webstore earlier and I could not track down the original creator, so I used some archiving tools to get the source code so I can load it unpacked. Sharing it here for storage and making it available for others to use. If you are the original owner and want me to take it down, let me know.

## Description
This tool enhances the linkedin UI by adding extra options to make your daily to day tasks easier.
The Xtra components added match exactly with linkedin's original UI components both visually and technically.

Available features:
1. Auto invite all your connections to join your group
2. Accept all incoming invitations at once
3. Withdraw all pending sent invitations starting from current page (you can navigate to page where old sent invitations present and start withdrawing from there)
4. Auto send connection requests *without* message - from people search results
5. Select all conversations in the Inbox matching all selected filters + auto scroll until all conversations are loaded - This feature can be helpful if you are looking to delete certain conversations that matches your keyword search in bulk
